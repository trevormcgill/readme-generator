# README Generator

## Description
In this challenge, I developed a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from user input, utilizing the Inquirer package. The application, invoked with node index.js, prompts users for information about their project, such as project name, description, installation commands, usage information, contribution guidelines, test commands, and license type.

Based on the user's input, the application creates a well-structured README.md file, which includes a table of contents, installation instructions, usage information, license information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, and contact information. Helper functions generate a license badge and license notice depending on the chosen license, and the fs package is used to write the generated content to a new file, 'NEWREADME.md'. The end result is a dynamically generated, professional README.md file that effectively represents the user's project.
