## Description
In this challenge, I was given starter code and had to modify it to create a work-day scheduler. First, I had to use dayjs() to get the current date and time. Then, I had to add a click event listener to the save button to save the user's input to localStorage when clicked. Finally, I used an if/else statement to compare the id of each time block element to the current hour and modify the classes accordingly. This allows the user to see which events were in the past, present, and future with color-coded elements that update every hour. The end result is a fully functional work-day scheduler that allows the user to enter and save their daily events.
